This project shines with a plethora of features designed for you:

🚀 Real-Time Updates: Stay in the loop with live news, events, and career opportunities.

📂 Resource Library: An extensive library of resources, from job postings to alumni success stories.

🤝 Connect and Network: Build valuable connections with other graduates and employers.

📚 Personalized Experience: Tailor the platform to your interests and goals.



**🙏 Acknowledgements**

We'd like to express our gratitude to the open-source community, the US Air Force Academy, and all the amazing alumni who believed in this project. We are so blessed to be _from_ the Zoo. Remember to be a good person and spread the word!
