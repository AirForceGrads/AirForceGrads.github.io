# Welcome, Air Force Grads ✈️

## ✨ Introduction
👋 Hi, my name is Ryan.

🖥️ Welcome to the ultimate platform for Air Force Academy alumni. We are a website built for grads who are looking to upskill or transition from the military to the private sector. Together, through feedback and a timely, iterative development process, we'll help people from re-creating the same decision wheel that so many of us do each year. 

🟢 We are building this website to help other military graduates. So, if you're interested in what life could be like in the private sector——whether it is attending graduate school (JD, MBA, MD, etc.) or finding a high-paying job because you are done with school——we're here to help you bridget that gap. Simply put, we're the best and lowest-cost resource to building a better life for yourself and your family. 

⏰ Whether you serve for 40 years or five-and-dive (like myself), you'll likely find yourself at a crossroad. That is, what should you do in the private sector? Well, it's a hard question. But we owe it to ourselves and our loved ones to find a meaningful pursuit. It's a leap _into_ faith. So, whether you want to be an architect, run a construction firm, or live in NYC as a singer-songwriter, we're here to help facilitate those dreams.

## 📋 Features
🏡 We believe that everyone has a purpose. Some say this must be discovered, while others say it is innate——either way, we want to help facilitate better outcomes for the community that we care so much about. 

We promise to create...
  
  🚀 1. Real-Time Updates: Stay in the loop with live news, events, and career opportunities.

  📂 2. Resource Library: An extensive library of resources, from job postings to alumni success stories.

  🤝 3. Connect and Network: Build valuable connections with other graduates and employers.

Therefore, we are committing ourselves to develop what others have not and will not. We're not in it for money. We're here to build actually useful features for people who need and want assistance with tough, real-life decisions.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

We'd like to express our gratitude to the open-source community, the US Air Force Academy, and all the amazing alumni who believed in this project. We are so blessed to be _from_ the Zoo. Remember to be a good person and spread the word!
