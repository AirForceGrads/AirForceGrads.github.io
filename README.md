# Welcome, Air Force Grads ✈️

##  Long Blue Line
Hi!! 👋

Welcome to the ultimate platform for Air Force Academy alumni. My name is Ryan, and I'm building this website to help military academy graduates find a meaningful and happy life in the private sector. Whether you serve for 40 years, 20 years, or 5-and-dive (like me), we owe it to ourselves and our community to be a positive influence in the lives of others. All this said, we're a website built for grads. It's as simple as that. We believe in building useful applications, primarily on the web, to connect people and streamline their decision processes.
