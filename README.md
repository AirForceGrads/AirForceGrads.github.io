# Welcome, Air Force Grads ✈️

##  Long Blue Line
👋 Hi, my name is Ryan.

🖥️ Welcome to the ultimate platform for Air Force Academy alumni. We are a website built for grads who are looking to upskill or transition from the military to the private sector. Together, through feedback and a timely, iterative development process, we'll help people from re-creating the same decision wheel that so many of us do each year. 

🟢 Instead of waiting for someone else to solve this problem, I decided to build this website and help other graduates. So, if you are interested in what life could be like in the private sector, whether it is attending graduate school of some kind (JD, MBA, MD, etc.) or whether you want to find a high-paying job and are sick of school——we're the best and lowest-cost way on the internet to building a better life. All the information on this website is for Air Force Academy graduates. 

⏰ Whether you serve for 40 years or five-and-dive (like myself), we owe it to ourselves and our loved ones to find meaning in the private sector. We went to a military academy because we wanted to serve our communities and that shouldn't change on the outside. Of course, how you do that is up to you!
